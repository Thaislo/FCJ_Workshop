### Overview
**Data visualization** presents data in graphical form, making it easier to understand and absorb. It allows users to gain better insights from the data to make informed decisions.

We will access the enriched data, which is currently stored in **Amazon S3**, and then visualize this data in **Amazon QuickSight**.
