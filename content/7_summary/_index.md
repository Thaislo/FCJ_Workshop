#### Data Processing Workflow
- **Data Ingestion**: You ingested data from various sources into Amazon S3, the central data repository. This step involved collecting and storing raw data in its original format for later processing.

- **Data Transformation**: Using AWS Glue, you defined and executed ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) jobs to process the raw data stored in S3. These jobs transformed the data into a structured format suitable for analysis and reporting.

- **Data Catalog**: AWS Glue Data Catalog plays a crucial role in organizing and managing metadata for your data lake. It provides a centralized repository for storing schema definitions, data lineage, and other metadata related to your datasets.

- **Data Analysis**: With Amazon Athena, you queried and analyzed the transformed data stored in S3 using standard SQL syntax. Athenaâ€™s serverless architecture allows you to perform ad-hoc queries without provisioning or managing infrastructure.

- **Data Visualization**: Finally, you connected Amazon QuickSight to your data sources, enabling you to create visualizations and interactive dashboards. QuickSight offers a user-friendly interface to explore and present insights from your data.
